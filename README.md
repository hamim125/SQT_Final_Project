Background to the Problem:
Task management and organization have to become more effective in today's fast-paced, connected world due to the growing demands of work, personal responsibilities, and social obligations. Keeping track of tasks and
appointments have become increasingly difficult as people manage multiple responsibilities and move between distinct locations. The dynamic nature of modern lifestyles is often not sufficiently managed by traditional
reminder systems that rely on manual input and time-based alerts. Due to this lack of task management, people who are attempting to keep up with their daily activities may miss appointments, forget to run errands, or experience higher levels of stress.

A solution to the Problem:
With the GPS-based reminder system, users may program reminders to go off depending on where they are at any given time. The user receives alerts when they enter or leave a designated geographic area and the system
employs GPS technology to establish the user's present location. The software program will work with most operating systems and be accessible on portable devices like tablets and smartphones.
Giving people a quick and easy way to organize their chores and reminders is the goal of the GPS-based reminder system. Users will be able to create reminders for a variety of chores, including appointments,
meetings, and shopping lists, and they will be able to receive alerts when those tasks are about to be completed. Users will also be able to alter the reminder settings on the system.
